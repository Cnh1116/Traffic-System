# Traffic-System
# This is a system using serial connections from a Raspberry Pi 4 and an Arduino Mega 2560 to emulate
# a traffic light system. Raspberry Pi performed the logic and computations, and the Arduino controlled
# the components, such as four of the LEDs, the keypad for shuttinf the system down, the buzzer needed
# for the emergency override case, and the LCD screen.
